IMPROVEMENT QUEST GAME

"You are a little pixel looking for growing as a real character and finding your developers. During your adventure, you have to achieve some staff you earn killing monsters and testing yourself. There are many references to other games and some irony from the videogames industry."

We have created all art in the game, but we are not the original authors of the idea os some characters (like Zelda, Mario, etc).
